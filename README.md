#Social Media Dashboard 
This is a functional Single Page Application (SPA) built with React.js that simulates a social media feed environment. It allows users to toggle between viewing a feed of posts and creating new content through a dynamic, state-driven interface.

#Core Features
1. Centralized State Management: Uses the React Context API (PostListProvider) to manage and distribute post data throughout the application without prop-drilling.
2. Dynamic Navigation: Features a sidebar-driven navigation system that utilizes React useState to switch views between the "Home" feed and "Create Post" forms.
3. Modern UI Layout: Built with a responsive Flexbox architecture, ensuring the sidebar and main content area scale correctly across different screen sizes.

Bootstrap Integration: Leverages Bootstrap 5 for consistent styling of components like headers, footers, and buttons.

Technical Stack
Frontend: React.js (Hooks, Context API)

Styling: CSS3 (Flexbox), Bootstrap 5

Build Tool: Vite (indicated by main.jsx structure)
